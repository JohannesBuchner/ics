InterClient Communication Service
=============================================

The task of the InterClient Communication Service (ics) is to provide a
commmunication layer based on the network for communication between users
based on messages and objects.


Furthermore, it provides a method of addressing content: A user can be asked for a 
content by a name (called "file name", but the mapping is programmable and not 
strictly bound to files). The transfer, progress and control over it is also handled.

The ics is meant to be network platform independent. Currently, the service has 
implementations for XMPP.

Why not use an existing library for XMPP?
-------------------------------------------
ics-xmpp is based on a very good and popular XMPP library, Smack.
